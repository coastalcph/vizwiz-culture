Cultural information encompasses content that showcases the distinctive characteristics, artifacts, or manifestations of a specific group, community, or region. 
This includes, but is not limited to, practices, behaviors, norms, values, beliefs, habits, customs, architectural styles, environmental engagements, and any other elements that are emblematic of a particular cultural setting. 
It does not include generic information or widespread practices that are not distinctly tied to a specific cultural identity. 

For this task, consider information as "cultural" if:
1. It is associated with or characteristic of a specific identified group (e.g., Americans, Italians, midwestern Americans, etc.).
2. It reveals a unique aspect of that groupâ€™s way of life, including social conventions, physical creations, or interactions with their surroundings that are not typically seen in other cultures.
3. It provides insight into the cultural uniqueness, whether through social practices, material culture, or other culturally significant elements.

Please exclude generic or ubiquitous statements or observations that do not clearly relate to the unique cultural context of a specific group.
